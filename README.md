The following repository contains two of my real world projects I created for the School ERP Software company, PrayagEdu during my summer 2024 internship with them.

The first project consist of an ML model whose purpose is to predict the feature of the website the user might be using at a given time of the day with the help of training the model with past records 

The second project is an Late Attendance Tracker model which throught the late attendance database of the school analyses the students who are being frequently late and is there any pattern in their late 
records this system will be connected with the frontend of the system with a push notification facility in the application.
